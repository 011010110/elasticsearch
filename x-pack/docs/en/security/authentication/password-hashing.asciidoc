=== Password hashing

Credential storage for applicable realms (<<file-realm,`file`>> and
<<native-realm,`native`) follows security best practices, in order
to limit exposure to credential theft and mitigate
credential compromise.

Passwords are stored hashed using cryptographically strong and password specific
salt values. Hashing involves the use of an adaptive hash function with a configurable
work factor to suit current and future needs.

You can configure the desirable algorithm to be used for password hashing by setting
the `xpack.security.authc.password_hashing.algorithm` setting. See 
{ref}/security-settings.html#password-hashing-settings[Password hashing settings].
